## 1. Dimensional modeling definiton
- A method of organizing data in a specific way (common in data warehouse)
- Optimized for fast retrieval, performance and usability
- Good for reporting, OLAP use cases
### a. Structure overview
- Dimensional modeling technique involve organizing data into 2 parts
- Fact: Measurements. Ex: Profit
- Dimensions: Context of the measurements. Ex: product_category
  - Many dimension can clustered around the fact (Star schema)

## 2. Why dimensional modeling
- For fast data retrieval
- Focus on performance and usability
- Since many databases are stored in rows, thus tables with wide structure tend to suffer in terms of performance more compare to narrower tables
  - Wide tables can contain many duplicate data
- Only keep foreign keys which can be used to reference related information about context of specific measurement in other dimensions
  - Reduce duplicate, redundancy
  - Faster query performance
  - Better usability due to its structure
  - Thus, preferred technique for data warehouse
