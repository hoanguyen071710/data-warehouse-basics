## 1. Dimensional modeling definiton
- A method of organizing data in a specific way (common in data warehouse)
- Optimized for fast retrieval, performance and usability
- Good for reporting, OLAP use cases
### a. Structure overview
- Dimensional modeling technique involve organizing data into 2 parts
- Fact: Measurements. Ex: Profit
- Dimensions: Context of the measurements. Ex: product_category
  - Many dimension can clustered around the fact (Star schema)

## 2. Why dimensional modeling
- For fast data retrieval
- Focus on performance and usability
- Since many databases are stored in rows, thus tables with wide structure tend to suffer in terms of performance more compare to narrower tables
  - Wide tables can contain many duplicate data
- Only keep foreign keys which can be used to reference related information about context of specific measurement in other dimensions
  - Reduce duplicate, redundancy
  - Faster query performance
  - Better usability due to its structure
  - Thus, preferred technique for data warehouse
    
## 3. Facts
- Center of the Star schema
- Contains important measurements
- To be aggregated and analyzed
- Difference with dimensions:
  - Usually aggregatable (numerical values)
  - Measurable rather than descriptive
  - Event or transactional-based data
    - Because of the event/transactional nature of fact, it usually contains a date/time column (fk reference to date dimension)
- Component: PK, FK, Facts
- Grain: Most atomic level a fact can be defined
  - Ex: Profit of every single region in a single date -> id, date_id, region_id, profit
  - Each row represent profit of specific region in a single date

## 4. Dimension
- Get meaningful context for facts
- Supportive and descriptive nature
- Allow filtering, grouping and labeling data
- Difference vs fact:
  - Non-aggregate despite numerical. Ex: years
  - Descriptive nature not measurable
  - (More) Static compare to fact. Ex: product name can change but not very often
- Component: PK, Dimension, (FK)
  - Sometimes also contain FK in the case of Snowflake schema

## 5. Star schema
- Data arrange in facts and dimensions
- Foreign key (Fk) and primary key (PK) made up the relationships between fact and dimensions
- One to many
  - Ex: Product dim PK occur only once every row (one), whereas these ids can repeat in multiple rows in fact table (many)
- Some level of redundancy is acceptable in dimensions due to its read performance and user-friendliness

| Normalized                               | Denormalized                |
|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|
|Minimize storage                          |Optimized in getting data out|
|Good write performance, easier to maintain|Good read performance        |
|Many tables, more complex queries, joins  |User-friendly                |

- In some cases, there can be more than one fact table
  - Which can led to one dim have multiple connections to multiple fact tables
