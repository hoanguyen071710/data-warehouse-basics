## 1. Addivity
- Usually facts are numerical values, it is intuitive to add them up
- However, not all fact are addable
### a. Additive
- Can be added up across all dimensions
- Most common and flexible
- Ex: Units sold. Total units sold, total units sold by product category, etc.
### b. Semi-additive
- Can be add across few dimensions
- Ex: Account balances
  - Account balances are already the sum of money after transactions, so adding these balances up across date make no sense
  - However, adding the balances of different portfolio in a single date can make sense. Ex: Stock + Cash in Jan 1
  - In another case, average balance can be calculated across date
### c. Non-additive
- Cannot be add across dimensions
- Limited analytical value
- Ex: Price
  - Summing up price only makes sense when multiple with quantity
  - Average can also be tricky with the existence of quantity, when cannot calculate average(price) of a product category without consider the quantity ordered
- Other examples: percentage, ratio, etc.

## 2. Types of fact table
### a. Transactional fact table
- 1 row = measurement of 1 event/transaction
- Taken place at a specific time
- One transaction defines the lowest grain
- Characterstics:
  - Most common and flexible
  - Typically additive
  - Have many dimensions associated with it
  - Can be enourmouse in size
### b. Periodic snapshot fact table
- 1 row = summarize measure of many events/transactions
- In a standard period (e.g 1 day, 1 week)
- The lowest/standard period defines the grain
- Ex: Sales transaction fact by week
- Usally alot of measures, but not many dimensions
  - Ex: week_id, revenue, sales, cost
  - Ex2: day_id, no of calls, missed calls, durations
- Characteristics
  - Tend to not be enormous
  - Typically additive
  - Tend to have a lot of facts, but not many dimension associated
### c. Accumulating snapshot fact table
- 1 row = summarize measure of many events/transactions
- No more standardized timespan but lifespan of one process (e.g order fulfillment)
- Definite beginning and definite ending (and steps in between)
- Suitable for workflow analysis, or process analysis
- Contains some measure, but many date dimensions
  - Ex: Order fulfilment. order_id, order_date_fk, purchase_date_fk, product_start_date_fk, production_end_date_fk, shipping_date_fk
- Characteristics:
  - Least common
  - Used when the workflow, or the process anlysis is very important
  - Multiple date/time FK for each steps in the process, which is connected to only one date dimension (role-playing dimension)
### d. Factless fact table
- Only dimensions are recorded
