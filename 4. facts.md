## 1. Addivity
- Usually facts are numerical values, it is intuitive to add them up
- However, not all fact are addable
### a. Additive
- Can be added up across all dimensions
- Most common and flexible
- Ex: Units sold. Total units sold, total units sold by product category, etc.
### b. Semi-additive
- Can be add across few dimensions
- Ex: Account balances
  - Account balances are already the sum of money after transactions, so adding these balances up across date make no sense
  - However, adding the balances of different portfolio in a single date can make sense. Ex: Stock + Cash in Jan 1
  - In another case, average balance can be calculated across date
### c. Non-additive
- Cannot be add across dimensions
- Limited analytical value
- Ex: Price
  - Summing up price only makes sense when multiple with quantity
  - Average can also be tricky with the existence of quantity, when cannot calculate average(price) of a product category without consider the quantity ordered
- Other examples: percentage, ratio, etc.

## 2. Types of fact table
### a. Transactional fact table
- 1 row = measurement of 1 event/transaction
- Taken place at a specific time
- One transaction defines the lowest grain
- Characterstics:
  - Most common and flexible
  - Typically additive
  - Have many dimensions associated with it
  - Can be enourmouse in size
