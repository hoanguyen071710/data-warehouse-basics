## 1. Layers
- Data source -> Staging -> Core/ Data warehouse -> Data Mart (Optional) -> BI
- The core is often considered the dw by users, however, all of these layers can also be called the dw

## 2. Staging layer
### a. Why staging
- Extract data from different sources, formats, etc.
- Limit time spent on data source/ operational systems
  - These systems turning the wheel of company, which should not be slowed down
- Extracted data to be moved into relational database
- Start transformations here
### b. Temporary (Non-persistent) staging layer
- Being truncated after every ETL cycle
- Delta columns will be needed for identifying new values
- Ex: status, date, etc.
- Most cases, date column is delta column due to its ascending nature
- Cons: Some cases, mistakes can caused data to be roll back to previous dates, mitigate by using persistent staging layer
### c. Persistent staging layer
- Data never get truncated
- Make it easier to roll back in time
