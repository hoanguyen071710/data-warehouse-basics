## 1. Definition
- Dimensions usually static compare to fact, but changes still happen
- We need a strategy to handle those changes
- How to go about these changes:
  - Be proactive and ask about potential changes, since business users can be quite inactive or unaware of these potential changes

## 2. Type 0: Retain original
- Applicable when there are no changes occur in our dimensions
- Don't need to implement strategy, can be left as they are
- Ex: Date table, except maybe some changing attribute like company holidays
- "Original" label value
  - Ex: Original product name
- No changes lead to simple and easy to maintain

## 3. Type 1: Overwrite
- These changes reflect into dimensions
- Overwrite old values with new values
- Thus, only current state, current values are reflected in dimension
- No fact table needs to be modified
- Problems
  - Don't have historical changes
  - Works only with insignificant changes
  - Might affect/break existing query
    - Ex: When product name changed, we can do not know what the facts of the product before the name changed are like, since the name has been overwrite

## 4. Type 2: Additional rows
### a. Overview
- Problem with type 1: No history
- Allow historical values to still be apparent, facts of dimension can be presented before and after change
  - Ex: Revenue can be recorded for old product category and changed product category, not just the current one
- Implementation:
  - Changes can be presented by adding new rows, not overwriting the current rows, with new surrogate key
  - When the new surrogate key is created, natural key remains
  - No changes need to be made in fact table, just use the new surrogate key (FK) of the updated value
- Problem
  - How can we identify the list of our current product? We cannot distinguish old and new records in the dimension table
### b. Administrate type 2
- Due to the problem mentioned above, we need to make some adjustment to the type 2 SCD
- Include effective date and expire date, which represents the period when the values are still valid
- New update value will have new valid period, thus we can identify is the current value
- Expiration date should not be null, always have a value like 9999-31-12
  - Allow more possible query like 'between'
- Require surrogate key, instead of natural key
  - Since PK need to be unique, and natural key remain unchaged when other attribute are updated, thus no more unique
- How to assure the correct FK?
  - Add new row to the dimension first
  - Lookup for that specific natural key in dim where the period is still valid, see what the SK over there is
  - We can add 'is_current' boolean column for easier filter

## 5. Mixing type 1 + 2
- Some field can be type 1 others can be type 2
  - Ex: Product name, old product name can just be overwrite, type 1
  - However, product category need to be tracked, type 2
  - This is a business users' decision

## 6. Type 3: Additional attribute
- We add additional columns recorded for the previous value
  - Ex: category column store current value, prev_category store the previous category value
- Use for significant and predictable change at a time, not frequennt (e.g restructuring in organizations)
- Problems
  - Not suitable for frequent and unpredictable changes -> better type 2
  - Minor change -> Type 1
